## ⚡ Lightning-Fast Natural Language Processing
No more fumbling with date pickers, time selectors, or complex forms! Just type or speak naturally:

- "Project deadline next Friday"
- "Meeting tomorrow afternoon"

## 🎤 Advanced Voice Commands with Smart Auto-Send
Revolutionary voice input with intelligent trigger word system! Say "pick up groceries tomorrow 3PM send" and QuickReminders automatically processes your command without touching a button. Customize your own trigger words like "done," "go," "submit," or "sent" in settings. The app recognizes variations and handles speech recognition restart seamlessly.
